      My journey in graphic and web design started with personalizing my MySpace profile and evolved into a career crafting digital experiences for diverse industries. Iâ€™ve designed and developed websites for commercial real estate, drone photography, and a century-old accordion manufacturer. Currently, I'm the lead front-end designer and developer for Fairytale Brownies, responsible for maintaining and updating Brownies.com.

        My role involves not just web design but also merchandising, data analytics, and collaborating with back-end developers. Although I wear many hats, my main priority is creating user-friendly, attractive websites that stand out, aiming for improved user engagement and conversion rates.

           When I'm not at a computer, I balance my life with music, swimming, and spending quality time with friends and my dog. I also teach piano as a side-gig and thoroughly enjoy playing many different types of music.
